## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Analysis Areas

- Default rate by credit grade  
- Risk analysis by DTI bucket  
- State-wise default comparison  
- Income and employment impact  
- High-risk customer segmentation  

---

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- Total Loans & Charged-Off Loans  
- Overall Default Rate  
- Average Loan Amount & DTI  
- Top 10 Risky States  
- Risk by Debt-to-Income Level  
- Interactive slicers (Year, Grade, State, Income)

---

##  Key Insights

- Higher DTI levels are associated with higher default rates  
- Lower credit grades show significantly higher risk  
- Some states consistently show elevated default patterns  
- Income stability impacts repayment behavior
